# DiceU
A simple software that rolls a dice, written in C++

<h1>Why DiceU?</h1>
<p>I don't really know to be honest, it's just a little side project I wrote in my process of learning C++. It has multiple different die,
a six sided die, a 8 sided die, a 10 sided die, a 12 sided die, and a 20 sided die. This can be useful in day to day life if you just want to roll a dice, however I don't really see the practicality of bringing out your computer to roll a dice lol</p>

<h1>How to run on your system</h1>
git clone the repo with

```sh
git clone https://github.com/photonmastr/diceu
```
and cd into the directory

```sh 
cd DiceU
```

and then just install a c++ compiler like GCC or G++ and just compile and run it

on GCC:

```sh
gcc -o DiceU DiceU.cpp
```

on G++:

```sh
g++ -o DiceU DiceU.cpp
```

to run once compiled:

```sh
./DiceU
```

or on windows

```sh
/.DiceU
```

Thanks for just trying it out and supporting my projects.

<h1>Extra Ideas</h1>
<p>It might be a good idea to add DiceU as a bash, zsh, or fish alias on your computer if you actually plan on using it a lot on your computer (for some reason) you can just do this with the echo command</p> 
<p>or on windows add a start menu shortcut to the .exe file<p>




By the way, if you're wondering why i'm learning so many languages it's because I don't entirely know what language I want to settle on right now so I am just experimenting.
